# Movietube

I created an app called Movietube based off version 3 of the Movie Data Base's API.

I used a movie search API where I created a form where users can search and get the result of their submitted response using DOM manipulation to create and append the searched movie title with poster image.

I then used my knowledge of event listeners to render out a modal box when the user clicks on a movie where it'll display the movie title, along with a description, rating and release date of the movie.

I also used The Movie DB's popular and upcoming movie API's. Using the slice method I rendered out the first 5 movies for each section for simplicity and a clean look.
